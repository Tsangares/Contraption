## Context

There are many snippets of code that need to talk to the various lab equipment.
Commonly we find ourselves copying the previous code and working form there.
This repo is to unify the code used to talk to all the lab devices.

If you need to add features to the classes in this repo, but do not want to edit this repo, simply inherit the classes and use these functions as your base.
If you feel like there are critical features that can be added to these classes, feel free to either make a pull request or fork the repo.
